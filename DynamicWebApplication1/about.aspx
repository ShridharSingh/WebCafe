                <p>At Dimension Data Cafe, we can proudly say that our employees are well taken care of in almost every way possible! 
                   From confectionery items, cakes, pastries, frozen foods, savouries to beverages, 
                   we strive to provide our employees with wholesome and high quality foods.
                </p>
    
                <p>We believe that happy and satisfied employees are happier and more productive employees, which is why
                    when the world went into "lockdown" we knew that change was necesaary and our old ordering system was not
                    going to be sufficient when it came to improving employee morale and keeping them fed - ready to take on the day.
                    We Had to be BETTER!!

               <br />
               
               <p> Our previous Food Ordering System, faced challenges like: not being able to facilitate the growing number of 
                   employees, lack of covid-19 protocols, lengthy queues and wait-times and general inefficiencies and errors,  
                   that would not be acceptable today with the tight schedules of employees - This caused the company decided 
                   to create and implement an Online Food Ordering System, which is not only quick, effective and efficient, 
                   but also adheres to covid-19 protocols. 

                </p>
                <p>Which is why, when we were faced with difficulties regarding the canteen, we knew this was a job for the 
                   “Codename Developers Next Door”. Our enthusiastic team of developers were able to analyse and design 
                    the problem effectively and implement it.
                </p>
                <p>The Online Food Ordering System allows employees to order any of the available menu items using their points.  
                    Points are allocated to each employee at the beginning of every month and are valid for that month only.

                 <p> The Online Food Ordering System includes many error handling checks, this ensures that employees are able to 
                     smoothly order their food and return to work.
                 </p>
                 
                 <p>The System also allows for managers to request reports based on the canteen. Managers can login with their 
                    credentials which are verified. Thereafter, they are redirected to the “MANAGER PAGES”. Managers are able to view:
                    Stock level reports,
                    Sales reports,
                    Employee credit user reports
                  </p>
